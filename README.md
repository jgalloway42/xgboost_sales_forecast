# XGBoost Sales Forecasting

This project was created to mimic the functionality outlined in the tutorial found [here](https://medium.com/@oemer.aslantas/a-real-world-example-of-predicting-sales-volume-using-xgboost-with-gridsearch-on-a-jupyternotebook-c6587506128d).

The project comprises data formating, feature engineering, EDA and optimization of an XGBoost regressor via gridsearch.  Overall the forecasting produced very good results with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.87.
